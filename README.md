Postmortem: Database Server Outage on June 8, 2024
Issue Summary:
Duration of Outage:
Start Time: June 8, 2024, 10:30 AM (UTC)
End Time: June 8, 2024, 12:15 PM (UTC)

Impact:
Our primary e-commerce service was down, preventing customers from completing purchases. Approximately 70% of our users experienced service disruptions, either through failed transactions or the inability to load product pages.

Root Cause:
The outage was caused by a misconfigured database connection pool that exhausted available connections, leading to a cascading failure of the application.

Timeline:
10:30 AM: Issue detected via automated monitoring alerts indicating database connection timeouts.

10:35 AM: Engineer on-call received alert and began investigation.

10:40 AM: Initial investigation focused on database server health, which appeared normal.

10:50 AM: Noticed spike in application server errors related to database connections.

11:00 AM: Assumed issue was related to recent database server patch; began rollback process.

11:20 AM: Rollback completed, but issue persisted.

11:25 AM: Incident escalated to database team.

11:35 AM: Database team identified high number of idle connections.

11:50 AM: Misconfiguration in the applicationâ€™s connection pool settings identified.

12:00 PM: Reconfigured connection pool settings and restarted application servers.

12:15 PM: Confirmed resolution of the issue, service fully restored.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Detailed Explanation of the Root Cause:
The primary cause of the outage was an incorrect configuration in the database connection pool settings. Specifically, the maximum number of connections was set too low, while the minimum idle connections were set too high. This led to a scenario where the connection pool quickly exhausted available connections under normal load, causing the application to throw errors when trying to establish new connections.

Detailed Explanation of the Resolution:
The database team modified the connection pool configuration to increase the maximum number of connections and decrease the minimum number of idle connections. These changes were applied to the configuration files of the affected application servers. After making these adjustments, the application servers were restarted to apply the new settings. Monitoring was intensified to ensure stability, and the system returned to normal operation.


Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements and Fixes:

Review and Optimize Connection Pool Settings: Regularly review and optimize database connection pool settings to ensure they are appropriate for current load conditions.
Enhanced Monitoring: Implement more granular monitoring for database connection pool metrics to detect similar issues more rapidly in the future.
Incident Response Training: Conduct regular training sessions for the engineering team on incident response protocols and best practices for debugging database-related issues.
Task List:

 Optimize Database Connection Pool Settings: Review current connection pool configurations and adjust as needed for all applications.
 Implement Granular Monitoring: Add monitoring for database connection pool metrics (e.g., active connections, idle connections, connection wait time).
 Develop Incident Playbooks: Create detailed playbooks for common types of outages, including database connection issues.
 Conduct Incident Response Drills: Schedule quarterly drills to simulate outages and improve team readiness.
 Review and Update Incident Response Procedures: Regularly update incident response procedures based on lessons learned from past incidents.
